## Genome-wide selection (GS)

- Use markers to improve selection for complex traits
    + traits that are highly polygenic (genetically variable)
    + select candidates based on genotype
- forms of genome-wide selection
    + marker-assisted: with phenotypes
    + marker-based: without phenotypes
- new paradigm with technology advances
    + improved statistical methods and software
    + cheap markers

## Old paradigm: marker prediction

- 1990s & 2000s: markers were expensive
- economic strategy:
    + first identify significant markers (QTL analysis)
    + use these when genotyping selection candidates
- estimate marker effects by multiple regression
    + treat as fixed effects in a mixed model

## marker assisted selection (MAS)

## New paradigm: use "all" markers

- using only significant markers to predict trait
    + good estimates (maybe) of those markers
    + but does not maximize accuracy
- many other better statistical methods
- simple but effective approach
    + treat marker effects as random in mixed model

## mixed model approach

$$ y = Zu + e $$
