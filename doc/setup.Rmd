## Communication Challenges

- English as 2nd, 3rd (4th?) language
- data experience and learned patterns
- stat experience and access to consultants
- math anxiety (see [Sheila Tobias books](http://sheilatobias.com/books.html))
- IT/computing experience and access to tools
- genetics knowledge
- communicating outside chosen field

## Communication Opportunities

- many online resources
    + <http://datacarpentry.org>: spreadsheet to R in 2 days
    + <https://www.lynda.com/>: online skills tutorials
    + [Professional Skills for Data Science](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/network-skills)
- open source tools are quite good
    + [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for data science
    + [Github](https://github.com/) for version control
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Box](https://www.box.com/), ...

## Setup

- install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
    + see [datacarpentry instructions](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
    + or next two slides
- install packages qtl, rrBLUP
- download or view <https://github.com/byandell/thailand>

## Install R

R: powerful programming language for data exploration, visualization, and analysis

- main R site: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- Thailand mirror: <http://mirrors.psu.ac.th/pub/cran/> (use this)
- Want version 3.2.2 or higher
- click on machine version to "**Download and Install R**"
- for Windows, click on "**base**"
- click on current version to install
- follow instructions

## Install Rstudio

RStudio: nice graphical interface for R projects

- <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/>
- click "**Download**" under "**RStudio Desktop Personal License**"
- click on "**Installer**" for your machine
- follow instructions for easy install

## Install R packages

- open up Rstudio, which opens R
- On console, type

```
install.packages("qtl", "rrBLUP")
```

This will install the two main packages we will use.

## qtl: R package help

- <http://rqtl.org> (lots of useful stuff here)
    + see [R/qtl Install steps](http://rqtl.org/tutorials/rqtltour2.pdf)
- A brief tour of R/qtl: [[pdf](http://rqtl.org/tutorials/rqtltour.pdf) | [code](http://rqtl.org/tutorials/rqtltour.R)]
- A shorter tour of R/qtl: [[pdf](http://rqtl.org/tutorials/rqtltour2.pdf) | [code](http://rqtl.org/tutorials/rqtltour2.R)]
- [R/qtl sample data formats](http://rqtl.org/sampledata/)
- [A Guide to QTL Mapping with R/qtl: book by Karl W. Broman & Åšaunak Sen](http://www.rqtl.org/book/)

## rrBLUP: R package help

- <http://potatobreeding.cals.wisc.edu/software/>
- [Amy Jacobson slides](http://pbgworks.org/sites/pbgworks.org/files/Introduction%20to%20Genomic%20Selection%20in%20R.pdf)
- [Jeff Endelman Notes](https://potatobreeding.cals.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2014/01/GS_tutorial.pdf)

## Other useful R packages

There is a very useful set of R packages that were recently developed, which are packaged together as the "Tidyverse" (<http://tidyverse.org/>). We will not use these directly, but they are worth knowing about.
To install them type the following on the Rstudio console:

```
install.packages(tidyverse)
```

This will install a number of small packages on your system.

For the advanced R/qtl2 section, there are further packages. We will discuss that later.
