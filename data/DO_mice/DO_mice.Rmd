This is a study of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice derived from 8 founder strains.

Files for DO mice are in the <https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2data/tree/master/DOex>.
You will need [DOex.zip](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2data/blob/master/DOex/DOex.zip) and [c2_snpinfo.rds](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2data/blob/master/DOex/c2_snpinfo.rds). This is a small subset for teaching purposes of the larger dataset.

## Setup

First we set up needed packages, or libraries.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(qtl2geno)
library(qtl2scan)
library(qtl2ggplot)
```

Could read in data over the internet. We do it here with local copy,
which is downloaded if not found.

```{r}
do_file <- "DOex.zip"
snp_file <- "c2_snpinfo.rds"
```

Get files from internet if they do not exist locally.

```{r}
web_address <- file.path("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rqtl/",
               "qtl2data/master/DOex")
if(!file.exists(do_file)) {
  download.file(file.path(web_address, do_file), do_file, quiet=TRUE)
}
if(!file.exists(snp_file)) {
  download.file(file.path(web_address, snp_file), snp_file, quiet=TRUE)
}
rm(web_address)
```

## Read cross object and subset to chr 2.

```{r}
DOex <- read_cross2(do_file)
```

```{r}
summary(DOex)
```

## Calculate genotype probabilities.

Calculate genotype probabilities. This can take some time and may create a huge file.
We reduce to the 8 allele probabilities, which is smaller.
We also put the physical map into the probs object.
For larger datasets, we save both objects, as they took some time to create.

```{r}
pr <- calc_genoprob(DOex, error_prob=0.002)
```

Convert to allele probabilities.
Switch map to physical map in Mbp.

```{r}
apr <- genoprob_to_alleleprob(pr)
apr$map <- DOex$pmap
```

## QTL Scan on chr 2

```{r}
pheno_scan <- scan1(apr, DOex$pheno)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
plot(pheno_scan)
```

## QTL scan with kinship adjustment.

Calculate kinship matrices using the `"loco"` option, which calculates kinship for each chromosome using SNPs from all but that chromosome.

```{r}
kinship <- calc_kinship(apr, "loco")
```

Create a copy of the phenotype matrix and rename the phenotype to `"OF_kinship"`
for plotting purposes. Do genome scan.

```{r}
pheno_2 <- DOex$pheno
dimnames(pheno_2)[[2]] <- "OF_kinship"
pheno_scan_2 <- scan1(apr, pheno_2, kinship)
plot(pheno_scan_2)
```

Bind the two scans together and plot.

```{r}
pheno_scan_2 <- cbind(pheno_scan, pheno_scan_2)
plot(pheno_scan_2, 1:2)
```

## Subset to chr 2

```{r}
plot(pheno_scan_2, 1:2, chr="2")
```


# Set up SNP info on chr 2.

Read `snpinfo` from file.

```{r}
snpinfo <- readRDS(snp_file)
```

Calculate strain distribution patterns.

```{r}
snpinfo$sdp <- calc_sdp(snpinfo[,-(1:4)])
```

Convert to snp probabilities.

```{r}
snppr <- genoprob_to_snpprob(apr[,"2"], snpinfo)
```

## SNP association analysis

Perform SNP association analysis.

```{r}
out_snps <- scan1(snppr, DOex$pheno, kinship[["2"]])
```

Plot results

```{r}
plot(out_snps, cex=2, drop.hilit=2.5)
```

Show strain distribution patterns in SNPs.

```{r}
plot(out_snps, patterns="all",drop.hilit=2.5,cex=2)
```

Show only top strain distribution patterns in SNPs.

```{r}
plot(out_snps, patterns="hilit",drop.hilit=2.5,cex=2, ylim=c(4,8))
```
